## Briefs for each stage

### 🔴 Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### 🟡 Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### 🟢 Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### 🔵 Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### 🟣 Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

##### notes
My purpose of this sketch to create a calendar that changes the right mood of the day with emojis everytime the day changes. At first, I referred to Leo's sketch, but it was far from what I wanted to do so I dedcided to get help from AI generator this time. I learned another calls(coding) through AI generator.

'lastFrame' keeps track of the frame count when the text was last changed.
In the 'draw()' function, it checks if 60 frames (which is roughly equivalent to 1 second at 60 frames per secon) have elapsed since the last text change. If so, it increments'currentIndex' and updates 'lastFrame'. This endsures the text changes automatically without needing a mouse click.
I also wanted to indicate the number count that changes after finish each round. I added a 'weekCount' variable to keep track of the number of completed weeks. The "week:" label is displayed along with the 'weekCount' variable. When one round(a week) is completed(i.e. 'currentIndex' is back to 0). the 'weekCount' is increased by 1.
